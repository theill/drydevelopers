  		<h1>DRY Developers</h1>
<p>DRY (Don&#8217;t Repeat Yourself): &#8220;.. a process philosophy aimed at reducing duplication, particularly in computing&#8221; (from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">Wikipedia</a>).</p>
<p>DRY Developers is a gathering of independent software developers with a proven record of successful projects and a shared view on how to create software. We are passionate about web development and have a soft spot for <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>, but we also love to make to iPhone applications, desktop software, graphic design and most other things involving software. We know from experience that an agile and pragmatic approach delivers the highest quality in the shortest time, and we strive to work closely with the customer, develop and release software in small iterations and react and adapt quickly to the invaluable feedback this gives us.</p>
<p>Our large distribution of skills and diverse backgrounds enables us to work on most types of software development projects, but the common denominator is dynamic, database-driven websites. As our continuously growing collection of cases show, we are able to deliver complex websites end-to-end built from scratch. We are not married to any particular content management system or technical platform &#8211; we believe in the right tool for the right job.</p>
